## Overview

The "NeuralNetworkCoordinates" Python package is a specialized tool designed for researchers and practitioners in the field of neural networks. This package focuses on providing precise coordinates that capture the functional transformations within a neural network. Unlike conventional plotting packages, "NeuralNetworkCoordinates" does not generate plots directly. Instead, it offers a streamlined approach to obtaining the underlying coordinates, enabling users to create custom visualizations tailored to their specific needs.

This package is particularly useful for visualizing and understanding the intricate inner workings of neural network models. By offering a straightforward interface to access coordinates, researchers can gain insights into the spatial representation of features and activations within the network. "NeuralNetworkCoordinates" enhances the interpretability of neural network behavior, contributing to the broader goals of Explainable AI and facilitating more informed analyses of model performance and decision-making processes.
